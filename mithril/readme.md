# Bathhouse.js
_who would name a project Bathhouse.js?_

Well, I would. I'm kind of a comedian about my code.

I wanted a clever name for a collection of implementations of the same concept that utilizes different single page application frameworks per implementation.
Get it? Single page application? SPA? BATHHOUSE. __IT'S ALL COMING TO YOU NOW.__

It's basically a TODOMVC with a super contrived example of something like a music player.

## Process
I plan to work through a rough prototype in hardcoded HTML/CSS/JS (because structuring a project while trying to learn a framework is difficult).

## Implementations
Currently no implementations yet. Check back soon!
